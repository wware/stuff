<A name="apology"><H2>Apology, discussion and motivation</h2></A>
The genesis of this interpreter is a question posed by
students of a <I>LISP and Artificial Intelligence Programming Techniques</I>
course that I had developed and was teaching at Boston University in the
late 1980's:

<BLOCKQUOTE>How can we possibly hope to make use any of this stuff in 
work we are doing in other courses or in our jobs?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The problem being that both the commercial and non-commercial lisp
offerings at the time seemed to want to take over your entire
programming environment if you wanted to use lisp at all. 
A completely satisfactory solution to this problem will not be fully 
available again until a lisp system is written that uses
the same compiler back-end, debugging and runtime support as
all the other languages on a popular machine. But I digress.

<P>Knowing that the use of lisp didn't have to be so intrusive, 
but having very little
practical evidence at hand to actually prove the fact, I decided
one day while I was keeping the laboratory section room
open for course <B>EK201</B> to sit down and implement a demonstration
made up of a simple <B>cons</B>,
<b>arithmetic</b>, <B>read</b>, <b>eval</b>, and <b>print</b> 
in straightforward <B>C</B>
programming style, where the garbage collector was stop-and-copy and
could only run in the context of the toplevel loop. Defining and executing
<b>fib</b> resulted in a code-coverage of over 95% of the lines
of the C program. Hence, SIOD, Scheme in One Day. Borrowing the name
of a previous Scheme interpreter I had done to test the Lispmachine
microcode compiler, Scheme in One Defun.

<P>The motivation behind SIOD remains a small footprint, in every sense
of the word, at runtime, at compile time, and in <b>cognitive</b> attention
required to understand how the system works enough to be able to
extend it as well as the author would have done the work himself.

<P>About eight years have passed since that initial release. It has been
possible to add a feature or two without contributing to the cause
of software bloat, with the code segment of the libsiod shared
library remaining under 75K bytes on a prototypical comparison machine 
like a VAX. Furthermore, as the richness of the C runtime library 
available on most systems has improved over time, <B>SIOD</B> remains
a useful kind of glue to have in a software engineers toolbox.

<P>Please forgive the lack of full compliance with IEEE or R4RS
standards. Perhaps one of these days.

<A name="scheme"><H2>What is Scheme?</H2></A>

Scheme is a programming language, a dialect of the Lisp (List
Processing) family of languages, generally utilizing a syntax based on
parenthetical expressions delimited by whitespace, although 
<a href="#hello.scm">alternative</a> syntax capabilities are sometimes
available. An implementation
such as SIOD usually runs by default in an immediate execution mode,
where programs are parsed as they are entered, then executed with
the results being printed. Hence this set of examples with input
syntax suitable for either Microsoft QBASIC or SIOD:

<A name="builtin"><H2>Reference Section for built-in procedures</h2></A>

Note that the arguments to built-in procedures are always optional
and default to <B>()</B>. Many of these procedures call a C library function
of the same or similar name, in the obvious way. Therefore you can
refer to the unix manual page for more detailed information about
function behavior. Such procedures are indicated with a bold 
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">U</FONT></B>.

<h3>(%%%memref address)</h3>
This is a lowlevel routine which should not be invoked in normal code.
References a byte of memory at address. Used mostly to cause
a core dump for debugging purposes by referencing address 0 or -1.
<h3>(%%closure env code)</h3>
This is a lowlevel routine which should not be invoked in normal code.
If code is a cons of the form (arlist . body) then env is a list of frames,
and the application of the closure will invoke the interpreter.
Otherwise code should be of type tc_subr_X and the 
application of the closure will pass the env as the 
first argument to the C procedure implementing the subr.
<h3>(%%closure-code closure)</h3>
This is a lowlevel routine which should not be invoked in normal code.
Returns the code passed to %%closure.
<h3>(%%closure-env closure)</h3>
This is a lowlevel routine which should not be invoked in normal code.
Returns the env passed to %%closure.
<h3>(%%stack-limit amount silent)</h3>
If amount is non-null it sets the runtime stack check pointer to
allow for that number of bytes. If silent is non-null the resulting
(or current) stack size is returned, otherwise a message is printed.
<h3>(* x1 x2 ...)</h3>
Returns the product of all its arguments, or 1 if no arguments.
<h3>*after-gc*</h3>
A variable, the value is an express evaluated after the gc has done its
work. For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><TT>(set! *after-gc* '(if (< (gc-info 4) 5000) (allocate-heap)))</TT></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3>*args*</h3>
A variable, bound to the list of arguments passed to the main program siod.
<h3>(*catch tag body ...)</h3>
A special form. Tag is evaluated and kept in a special location while all
the forms in the body are evaluated. Normally returns the value of
the last form except if a *throw is encountered within the dynamic
scope of the evaluations. Errors may be caught by using a tag of 'errorobj.
<h3>*env*</h3>
A variable, bound to the list of environment values passed to the
main program siod.
<h3>*eval-history-ptr*</h3>
A variable, default (), but if set to a list (possibly circular) then
each call to eval will cause the car of the list to receive a pointer
to the form being evaluated, and then the variable will be set to
the cdr of the list. Useful for writing a retrospective trace debugging
capability.
<h3>*pi*</h3>
A variable, value 3.1416.
<h3>*plists*</h3>
A variable, internal to the implementation of get and putprop.
<h3>(*throw tag value)</h3>
Locates an active *catch for which the tag is identical and then
forces the *catch form to return the value.
<h3>*traced*</h3>
A variable, value is a list of procedures that have been traced.
<h3>(+ x1 x2 ...)</h3>
Returns the sum of its arguments.
<h3>(- x1 x2 ...)</h3>
With one argument returns the negation, returns the difference of
the first argument and the sum of the rest.
<h3>(/ x1 x2 ...)</h3>
With one argument returns the inverse, otherwise returns the quotiont
of the first argument and the product of the rest.
<h3>(&lt; x y)</h3>
Returns true if x is numerically less than y.
<h3>(&lt;= x y)</h3>
Returns true if x is numerically less than or equal to y.
<h3>(= x y)</h3>
Returns true if x is numerically equal to y.
<h3>(&gt; x y)</h3>
Returns true if x is numerically greater than y.
<h3>(&gt;= x y)</h3>
Returns true if x is numerically greater than or equal to y.
<h3>(F_GETLK fd ltype whence start len)</h3>
The fd may be an integer or file. The function
<b>fcntl</b> (<B><FONT SIZE="+2">U</FONT></B>) is called on the file 
descriptor and an appropriate <b>struct flock</b>
constructed from the ltype, whence, start and len arguments, and the
lock operation F_GETLK. The ltype may be F_RDLCK,F_UNLCK, or F_WRLCK.
Whence may be SEEK_CUR, SEEK_END or SEEK_SET.
<h3>(F_SETLK fd ltype whence start len)</h3>
Same as F_GETLCK but with lock operation F_SETLK. <B><FONT SIZE="+2">U</FONT></B>. 
<h3>F_SETLKW fd ltype whence start len)</h3>

Returns the absolute numerical value of x.
<h3>(access-problem? filename method)</h3>
Invokes the access function (<B><FONT SIZE="+2">U</FONT></B>) on
the filename and flags created from the method string which

if there is a problem with accessing the file in that way. For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><TT>(if (access-problem? "x.y" "r") (error "can't read x.y"))</TT></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3>(acos x)</h3>
Returns the inverse cosine of x.
<h3>(alarm seconds flag)</h3>
Invokes the alarm function (<B><FONT SIZE="+2">U</FONT></B>).
The handling of which will causes an error to be signaled in so many seconds.
But if flag is false then the error will not be signaled if the alarm took
place inside a system call or other critical code section.
<h3>(allocate-heap)</h3>
Attempts to allocate (call the C library malloc procedure) to obtain
an additional heap. The size of the heap and the maximum number of heaps 
are determined at startup time. Returns non-null if successful.
<h3>(and form1 form2 form3 ...)</h3>
A special form which causes the evaluation of its subforms in order,
from left to right, continuing if and only if the subform returns
a non-null value. 
<h3>(append l1 l2 l3 l4 ...)</h3>
Returns a list which the result of appending all of its arguments.
Example:

<h3>Extension: sql_oracle</h3>
Uses the OCI, Oracle Call Interface.
See the sql_oracle.scm module for examples.

<h3>Extension: sql_rdb</h3>
Uses the RDB SQL SERVICES, sqlsrv_xxxx routines. 
See the sql_rdb.scm module for examples.

<h3>Extension: sql_sybase</h3>
Uses the Sybase Client ct_xxxx routines.
See the sql_sybase.scm module for examples.
All these procedures may print error and warning messages
depending on the current verbose level, and also
assign the variable *sybase-message* with similar information.

<h4>(sybase-close [handle])</h4>
Closes the connection to the database handle which defaults
to the value of the variable *sybase*.

<h4>(sybase-execute [handle] string cmd-type key1 arg1 key2 arg2 ...)</h4>
Passes the string to the SQL server to be processed.
The cmd-type is one of the sybase command types, such as
CS_RPC_CMD or CS_LANG_CMD. The optional keys are procedure argument
names. Pass "" as the key for un-named positional arguments.
The result of sybase-execute is an list where the first
element represents the status and the rest is an association
list with CS_ROW_RESULT, CS_STATUS_RESULT, CS_PARAM_RESULT, 
and CS_MSG_RESULT elements. Rows are returned as lists of arrays.
The handle defaults to the value of the variable *sybase*.
<h4>(sybase-open key1 arg1 key2 arg2 ...)</h4>
Opens a connection to the database specified by the current
settings of the environment variables SYBASE and DSQUERY.
The possible argument keys are username, password, and appname.
A handle to the database connection structures is returned,
and also set as the value of the variable *sybase* if it is currently ().

<h4>(sybase-status [handle])</h4>
Returns an list with information about the connection status,
servername, and hostname. Handle defaults to the setting of *sybase*.

<h3>Extension: ss</h3>
Provides a simplified, stream-oriented interface to socket
functionality. <B><FONT SIZE="+2">U</FONT></B>.
Example usages in smtp.scm and http-server.scm.
This doesn't provide all the functionality and options that
a straight socket interface would provide, but it has proven to
be highly convenient for most client and server applications.

<h4>(get-protocol-name number)</h4>
Calls getprotobynumber, returns a list of names.
<h4>(get-service-name port-number)</h4>
Calls getservbyport. Returns a list of the protocol and the service
names.
<h4>(gethostbyaddr x)</h4>
Calls gethostbyaddr, operating on the numerical address x.
<h4>(gethostbyname name)</h4>
Calls gethostbyname returning a list where the first element
is the canonical host name and the rest is an association list
containing aliases, addr_list and addrtype. For example to
obtain a list of numerical address for the host:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><TT>(mapcar inet_addr
	(cdr (assq 'addr_list
		   (gethostbyname (gethostname)))))</TT></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<h4>(gethostname)</h4>
Returns the configured name of the host.
<h4>(inet_addr str)</h4>
Converts a "x.x.x.x" dotted notation string or a byte
array into a number.
<h4>(s-accept stream)</h4>
Returns a new stream based on accepting a connection
from the socket assocated with the specified stream which must
be in a listen state.
<h4>(s-close stream)</h4>
Closes the socket assocated with the stream.
<h4>(s-drain stream)</h4>
Reads all input from the socket associated with the stream.
<h4>(s-force-output stream)</h4>
Makes sure all buffered output is sent to the socket associated
with the stream.
<h4>(s-getc stream)</h4>
Reads one character from the stream. () on eof.
<h4>(s-gets stream)</h4>
Reads a line from the stream.
<h4>(s-open address port listen-flag)</h4>
When listen-flag is () this procedure establishes a connection
to the remote address and port specified. If listen-flag is true
it creates a socket bound to the local address and port and initiates.
The address may be a host name, a number, or a dot-string notation.
The port may be the name of a protocol or a number.
<h4>(s-putc char stream)</h4>
Outputs the char to the socket stream.
<h4>(s-puts string stream)</h4>
Outputs the string to the socket stream.
<h4>(s-read size-or-buffer stream)</h4>
Reads the specified number of characters from the stream,
returning a string or () on end of file, or attempts to fill the buffer with
characters from the stream, returning the actual number read.
<h4>(s-read-sexp stream)</h4>
Reads a standard symbolic lisp expression from the stream.
If the SIOD I/O was better modularized this procedure would not
be needed.

<h3>Extension: tar</h3>
This is helpful for the efficient implementation of utilities
that need to deal with tar files, avoiding repeated use of
the substring and datref functions.

<h4>*tar-header-size*</h4>
Bound to the size of a tar header: 512.
<h4>(checksum-tar-header string)</h4>
Computes the standard tar header checksum algorithm.
<h4>(decode-tar-header string)</h4>
Returns an association list containing entries for all the
standard components of a tar header structure. This can be
done using substring and string->number but this procedure is
faster and more convenient.

<A name="garbage"><H2>Garbage Collection</h2></A>

When SIOD was first released in April of 1988, it had a stop-and-copy
garbage collector which could only run at the toplevel of the
read-eval-print loop because it had no certain way of determine which
objects on the stack were truly pointers; unless of course the runtime
system was modified to make use of information the compiler provided to
the debugger, in a way that a real lisp compiler would be required to
provide. About that same time Jim O'Dell related to me the debugging
heuristic he had used in his port of Franz Lisp to the Macintosh, by
scanning the stack for items which appeared to be pointers but which
had not been properly found by the mark phase of the gc. I suggested
at the time that he might as well get rid of the explicit book-keeping
code spread throughout Franz Lisp and stick with the heuristic. But since
he had already found all the bugs in the book-keeping in the runtime
and compiler output there was little benefit and great risk to doing it.

<P>Then, by the time SIOD had been out for a year there had been
enough complaints about the lack of fully available GC that I was
motivated to utilize a stack heuristic, since I had no intention of
maintaining any explicit book-keeping code in the source. The published
arguments in favor of the conservative approach described by Hans
Boehm of Xerox Parc then reduced this design decision to a no-brainer,
and his implementation suggested the use of setjmp as a sufficiently
portable way for C code to get at the machine register set without
introducing assembling language. To SIOD then I added only about 300
bytes of VAX instructions to the size of the runtime system. 

<P>
There are two storage management techniques which may be chosen at runtime
by specifying the -g argument flag. 

<UL>
<LI>-g1 is stop-and-copy. This is the simplest and most
portable implementation. GC is only done at toplevel.
<LI>-g0 (the default) is mark-and-sweep. GC is done at any time, 
required or requested. However, the implementation is not as portable.
</UL>

<P>If you get strange errors on a machine architecture not listed
then you may be forced to use -g1 until you investigate and contact
the author for advise.

<h3>Stop and Copy</h3>

As one can see from the source, garbage collection is really quite an easy
thing. The procedure gc_relocate is about 25 lines of code, and
scan_newspace is about 15.

<P>
The real tricks in handling garbage collection are (in a copying gc):
<OL>
<LI>keeping track of locations containing objects
<LI>parsing the heap (in the space scanning)
</OL>

<P>The procedure gc_protect is called once (e.g. at startup) on each
<B>global</B> location which will contain a lisp object.

<P>That leaves the stack. The beleive is that if we had chosen not to 
use the argument
and return-value passing mechanism provided by the C-language
implementation, (also known as the "machine stack" and "machine
procedure calling mechanism) this lisp would be larger, slower, and
rather more difficult to read and understand. Furthermore it would be
considerably more painful to *add* functionality in the way of SUBR's
to the implementation.

<P>Aside from writing a very machine and compiler specific assembling language
routine for each C-language implementation, embodying assumptions about
the placement choices for arguments and local values, etc, we
are left with the following limitation: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>YOU CAN GC ONLY AT TOP-LEVEL</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, this fits in perfectly with the programming style imposed in
many user interface implementations including the MIT X-Window Toolkit.
In the X Toolkit, a callback or work procedure is not supposed to spend
much time implementing the action. Therefore it cannot have allocated
much storage, and the callback trampoline mechanism can post a work
procedure to call the garbage collector when needed.

<P>Our simple object format makes parsing the heap rather trivial.
In more complex situations one ends up requiring object headers or markers
of some kind to keep track of the actual storage lengths of objects
and what components of objects are lisp pointers.

<P>Because of the usefulness of strings, they were added by default into
SIOD 2.6. The implementation requires a hook that calls the C library
memory free procedure when an object is in oldspace and never
got relocated to newspace. Obviously this slows down the stop-and-sweep
GC, and removes one of the usual advantages it has over mark-and-sweep.

<H3>Mark and Sweep</H3>

In a mark-and-sweep GC the objects are not relocated. Instead
one only has to LOOK at objects which are referenced by the argument
frames and local variables of the underlying (in this case C-coded)
implementation procedures. If a pointer "LOOKS" like it is a valid
lisp object (see the procedure mark_locations_array) then it may be marked,
and the objects it points to may be marked, as being in-use storage which
is not linked into the freelist in the gc_sweep phase.

<P>Another advantage of the mark_and_sweep storage management technique is
that only one heap is required.

<P>The main disadvantages are:
<OL>
<LI>start-up cost to initially link freelist.
    (can be avoided by more general but slower NEWCELL code).
<LI>does not COMPACT or LOCALIZE the use of storage. This is poor engineering
    practice in a virtual memory environment.
<LI>the entire heap must be looked at, not just the parts with useful storage.
</OL>

<P>In general, mark-and-sweep is slower in that it has to look at more
memory locations for a given heap size, however the heap size can
be smaller for a given problem being solved. More complex analysis
is required when READ-ONLY, STATIC, storage spaces are used
(which we do not support, currently).
Additionally the most sophisticated stop-and-copy storage management
techniques take into account considerations of object usage temporality.

<P>The technique assumes that all machine registers the GC needs to
look at will be saved by a setjmp call into the save_regs_gc_mark data,
and that every thing else is on the C runtime stack. Hence we
have some assumptions that impact portability.

<A name="porting"><H2>Porting</h2></A>

The most heavily ifdef'd module is slibu.c because it utilizes "unix"
runtime functionality. You may want to start out by porting
the "sample" main program along with the modules needed to be static
linked with it.

<P>If your system or C runtime needs to poll for the interrupt signal
mechanism to work, then define INTERRUPT_CHECK to be something
useful.

<P>The STACK_LIMIT and STACK_CHECK macros may need to be conditionized.
They currently assume stack growth downward in virtual address.
The subr (%%stack-limit setting non-verbose) may be used to change the
limits at runtime.

<P>The stack and register marking code used in the mark-and-sweep GC
is unlikely to work on machines that do not keep the procedure call
stack in main memory at all times. It is assumed that setjmp saves
all registers into the jmp_buff data structure. If your target machine
architecture is radically different, such as using linked procedure
call frames of some kind, not organized as a stack, then it would be
best if you could find vendor-supported routines for walking these
frames, such as would be utilized by a debugger. The mark_locations
procedure can then be invoked multiple times with the proper start
and end addresses.

<P>If the stack is not always aligned (in LISP-PTR sense) then the 
gc_mark_and_sweep procedure will not work properly unless steps
are taken to work around the problem.

<P>Example, assuming a byte addressed 32-bit pointer machine:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><TT>
stack_start_ptr: [LISP-PTR(4)] 
                 [LISP-PTR(4)]
                 [RANDOM(4)]
                 [RANDOM(2)]
                 [LISP-PTR(4)]
                 [LISP-PTR(4)]
                 [RANDOM(2)]
                 [LISP-PTR(4)]
                 [LISP-PTR(4)]
stack_end:       [LISP-PTR(4)]
</TT></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>As mark_locations goes from start to end it will get off proper alignment
somewhere in the middle, and therefore the stack marking operation will
not properly identify some valid lisp pointers.

<P>Fortunately there is an easy fix to this. A more aggressive use of
our mark_locations procedure will suffice.

<P>For example, say that there might be 2-byte quantities inserted into
the stack. Then use two calls to mark_locations, as as in THINK_C
on the Macintosh:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><TT>
mark_locations(((char *)stack_start_ptr) + 0,((char *)&stack_end) + 0);
mark_locations(((char *)stack_start_ptr) + 2,((char *)&stack_end) + 2);
</TT></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If we think there might be 1-byte quantities, then 4 calls are required:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><TT>
mark_locations(((char *)stack_start_ptr) + 0,((char *)&stack_end) + 0);
mark_locations(((char *)stack_start_ptr) + 1,((char *)&stack_end) + 1);
mark_locations(((char *)stack_start_ptr) + 2,((char *)&stack_end) + 2);
mark_locations(((char *)stack_start_ptr) + 3,((char *)&stack_end) + 3);
</TT></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<A name="tiny"><H3>Porting to tiny machines</h3></A>
SIOD has been run on 16 bit machines, such as MS-DOS tiny memory
model and in palm tops.

<P>Some things to consider:
<UL>
<LI>changing the double data type in struct obj into a float.
<LI>changing mark and type to bytes, or bitfields in a byte.
<LI>reducing default sizes of heap, interned numbers, obarray_dim.
<LI>excluding modules such as slibu.c and md5.c
<LI>making sure constant strings are allocated by the linker
into read-only data sections.
</UL>

On larger machines the structure member alignment requirements
cause an array of struct obj to waste space. For example, on an ALPHA
with 64 bit pointers each cell takes up 24 bytes, even though
ideally only 18 would be required. Is it worth it to pay a price of
having a 33% overhead in order to buy simplicity? The most common
way of dealing with the alignment problem is to store the object
type and gc_mark some place else. Usually this means making assumptions
about memory addressing because it is important to be able to get the TYPE
as quickly as possible.

<P>There are certainly other was to organize data, avoiding the
use of the C programming <i>struct</i> support, and utilizing 
carefully contrived macro definitions instead. 


<A name="extwrite"><H2>Writing extensions in the C programming language</h2></A>

The file <b>siod.h</b> provides public declarations of C functions
that can be called by extensions. Although some things are missing,
having been put into the <b>siodp.h</b> file accidently, and some
may have been left out altogether. Any function available to be called
from Scheme interpreted programs can also be called from C programs,
using the same arguments and with the same return value. Hence
the claim for a small <i>cognitive-footprint</i> imposed on extension
authors.

<P>There are three common reasons for wanting to write an extension to the
system using the C programming language:

<OL>
<LI>For runtime efficiency.
<LI>To take advantage of operating system, or other runtime library
provided functionality.
<LI>To play games with evaluator semantics.
</OL>

<P>Some examples of the first class are the functions memq, and nth,
study them. These extensions are straightforward, and easy to debug from the C
language debugger, with the functions <b>err0</b>, <b>pr</b>, and
<b>prp</b> being provided to call back into the lisp runtime system
from the C debugger. 

<P>Some examples from the second class are the <b>ndbm</b>
and <b>regex</b> modules, and the support for commercial database
client interfaces. In many cases it is convenient to define
new scheme data types to encapsulate the complex state of
an API. Study how to utilize allocate_user_tc,
set_gc_hooks and set_print_hooks. Careful ordering of
storage allocation and interrupt management are important.
Also don't forget that most C programming API functions do not
handle being longjump'd through very well, so beware of how
you handle callbacks and SIGINT.

<P>Functions such as get_c_string, get_c_string_dim, get_c_long,
get_c_double, and get_c_file are usually all you need to get at the
data you require to get the job done. But beware of spoofing the
garbage collector. For example, never do something equivalent to this:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><TT>{LISP <b>x</b>;
 char *<b>z</b>;
 <B>x</B> = strcons(100,NULL);
 z = get_c_string(z);
 /* no further references to <B>x</B>, but <b>z</b> is used */
 }</TT></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Because there are no further references to <B>x</B>, the C compiler
might very well reuse the location on the stack in which <B>x</B> resided.
If there is any other consing then the garbage collector will go off
at some point in the future inside this function, and it will free
the memory pointed to by <b>z</b>. A potential example of this
sort of thing is the built-in procedure <B>lexec</b>. In theory
a C compiler might store envp and gcsafe in the same memory
location. But of course for other reasons it is impossible for that
to cause problems unless get_c_string was extended to
invoke the evaluator in some cases.


<P>If you want to play with evaluator semantics you need to study
the <b>leval</b> function and perhaps the <b>lapply</b> function too.
The <b>tc_fsubr</b> object is the conventional way to extend an
evaluator, but the <b>tc_msubr</b> is more powerfull and allows
for a modular tail recursion. The set_eval_hooks function allows for
arbitrary evalution semantics when the first element of a form
evaluates to a new datatype.

<H3>User Type Extension</H3>
If you use them then you must provide some information 
to the garbage collector.
To do this you can supply 4 functions,
<OL>
<LI>a user_relocate, takes an object and returns a new copy.
<LI>a user_scan, takes an object and calls relocate on its subparts.
<LI>a user_mark, takes an object and calls gc_mark on its subparts or
it may return one of these to avoid stack growth.
<LI>a user_free, takes an object to hack before it gets onto the freelist.
</OL>

<P>The variable kind_of_gc should be a long. 
It will receive 0 for mark-and-sweep, 1 for
stop-and-copy. Therefore set_gc_hooks should be called AFTER process_cla.
You must specify a relocate function with stop-and-copy. The scan
function may be NULL if your user types will not have lisp objects in them.
Under mark-and-sweep the mark function is required but the free function
may be NULL.

<P>You might also want to extend the printer. This is optional.

The fcn receives the object which should be printed to its second
argument, a struct gen_printio *, using procedures such as gput_st.

See the modules <b>sample.c</b> and <b>siod.c</b> for example main
program usage. Once the storage system is initialized the
most simple and useful interface into the interpreter is probably
the <B>repl_c_string</b> function.
