.TH SNDBLIT 1
.SH NAME
sndblit \- sound blitter for making electronic music
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sndblit
.RB [ \-d ]\ [ \-o\ outputfile ]\ [ \-s\ samplingfrequency ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sndblit
accepts blip descriptors and outputs a RIFF WAVE
.I (\.wav)
file. A "blip" is an instantaneous
snapshot of an audio spectrum. Like the persistence of vision that
makes movies work, the human hearing system perceives continuous sound
when you hear a sound generated by updating an audio spectrum about 30
times per second.
.B sndblit
exploits this persistence of hearing.
.PP
The input to
.B sndblit
is a blip descriptor file. The first line is a floating pointer
number, the blip duration, and an int, the total number of blips in
the file. This is followed by one descriptor for each blip.
.PP
Each blip descriptor starts with one line, the number of sinusoids in
this blip. For each sinusoid there is a line with five floats, the
frequency, left channel cosine component, left channel sine component,
right channel cosine component, and right channel sine component.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-input\-file
Specifies an input file. If not provided, blip descriptors are read
from standard input.
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-output\-file
Specifies an output file. If not provided, the default output file is
.I sndblit_output.wav.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Run in verbose mode, printing information about the sinusoids within
each blip.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-sampling\-frequency
Specifies a new sampling frequency. The default sampling frequency
is 44100 Hertz, audio CD quality.
.TP
.B \-h, \-?, \-\-help
Print helpful(?) usage information.
