    This directory contains source code for data structures which
implement balanced binary trees (red-black trees) and interval trees.
The main source code files are:
    
    RedBlackTree.h, RedBlackTree.cc
    interval_tree.cc, interval_tree.h

    These files depend on:

    misc.h (miscellaneous stuff like safe version of malloc + assert macro)
    TemplateStack.H (array based stacks via templates)

    The other files are used to run regression tests.  gmake test runs
all the current regression tests and reports the results.
